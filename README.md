# VISL

The "tests" project requires that the "VISL" project is built and installed to maven:
- go into the VISL directory and run 'mvn install'

To run the tests, go into the tests directory and run 'mvn test'. This will test all feature definitions in the tests/src/test/resources/com/tests directory.
